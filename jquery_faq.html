<p>NATIONAL PARKS:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
    <dd>The National Park Service was created by
        an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson
        on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park
        was established by an act signed by
        President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872,
        as the nation's first national park.

    <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
    <dd>Some national parks welcome pets—in developed
        areas, on many trails and campgrounds, and in
        some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets
        in parks.</dd>

    <dt>Can I bring my service dog to a national park?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, service dogs are legally permitted anywhere
        in a park that visitors can go. Learn more about
        service animals in national parks, including the
        difference between service animals and emotional
        support animals.</dd>

    <dt>What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
    <dd>Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend
        to visit. In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal.
        Where off-road driving is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.</dd>

    <dt>What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
    <dd>The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior.
        Directly overseeing its operation is the department's
        Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</dd>

    <dt>Who is the director of the National Park Service?</dt>
    <dd>David Vela is the Deputy Director, exercising the
        authority of the Director of the National Park Service.</dd>

    <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
    <dd>The National Park Service was created by
        an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson
        on August 25, 1916.</dd>

    <dt>How do I get there?</dt>
    <dd>Three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National
        Park are located in Montana’s Yellowstone Country;
        they can be accessed through West Yellowstone,
        Gardiner and Cooke City, MT.</dd>

    <dt>Is the park open year-round?</dt>
    <dd>The park is open all year, but not all of the roads
        are open to motorized vehicles during the winter,
        which makes it a magical time to visit. </dd>

    <dt>What animals can I expect to see?</dt>
    <dd>While we can’t guarantee wildlife sightings,
        Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of
        mammals in the United States, so your chances of
        spotting some are pretty good.</dd>

<h3>San Antonio Missions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>After 10,000 years, the people of South Texas found their cultures, their very lives under attack.</li>
    <li>In the early 1700s Apache raided from the north, deadly diseases traveled from Mexico, and drought lingered.</li>
    <li>Survival lay in the missions.</li>
    <li>By entering a mission, they foreswore their traditional life to become Spanish, accepting a new religion and pledging fealty to a distant and unseen king.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Death Valley</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In this below-sea-level basin, steady drought and record summer heat make Death Valley a land of extremes</li>
    <li>Yet, each extreme has a striking contrast</li>
    <li>Towering peaks are frosted with winter snow.</li>
    <li>Rare rainstorms bring vast fields of wildflowers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Olympic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With its incredible range of precipitation and elevation, diversity is the hallmark of Olympic National Park.</li>
    <li>Encompassing nearly a million acres,</li>
    <li>he park protects a vast wilderness</li>
    <li>thousands of years of human history,</li>
</ul>
